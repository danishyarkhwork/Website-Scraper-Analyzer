The SEO Analyzer is a web application that allows users to input a URL, analyze its SEO performance, and display the results, such as title tags, meta descriptions, H1 tags, image alt tags, canonical tags, and an overall SEO score. The project is built using Node.js for the backend and HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
