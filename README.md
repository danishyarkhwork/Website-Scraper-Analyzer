SEO Analyzer
Overview
The SEO Analyzer is a web application that allows users to input a URL, analyze its SEO performance, and display the results, such as title tags, meta descriptions, H1 tags, image alt tags, canonical tags, and an overall SEO score. The project is built using Node.js for the backend and HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Features
Analyze SEO elements of a given URL, such as:
Title Tag
Meta Description
H1 Tags
Image Alt Tags
Canonical Tag
SEO Score
Simple and clean user interface using Tailwind CSS.
Basic scoring system to assess the overall SEO health of the page.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend server to handle URL analysis and SEO checks.
Express.js: Web framework to serve the frontend and handle API requests.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch HTML content from the provided URL.
Cheerio: Used to parse the HTML content and extract SEO-related elements.
Tailwind CSS: Frontend framework for building a responsive and modern UI.
Project Structure
lua
Copy code
/project-root
  /public
    index.html     <-- Frontend HTML file
    styles.css     <-- (Optional) Custom styles for Tailwind
    script.js      <-- Frontend JavaScript (if needed)
  server.js        <-- Node.js backend server
  package.json     <-- Project configuration and dependencies
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12.x or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/seo-analyzer.git
cd seo-analyzer
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
1. Running the Application
After installing the dependencies, you can start the Node.js server. This server will handle both the frontend (HTML) and backend (SEO analysis logic).

To run the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
By default, the server will run on http://localhost:3000. You can open this in your browser to access the frontend interface.

2. Using the Application
Input a URL: Enter the URL of the website you want to analyze in the provided input field.
Click "Analyze": After entering the URL, click the "Analyze" button. The server will fetch the page content, analyze the SEO elements, and display the results on the page.
View SEO Results: The results will display key SEO metrics, including the title tag, meta description, H1 tags, images with alt attributes, canonical tags, and the overall SEO score.

Code Breakdown
Backend: server.js
The Node.js server performs the following tasks:

Serves static files from the public directory using express.static().
Listens for POST requests to the /analyze-seo endpoint. When a request is made, the backend:
Uses Axios to fetch the HTML content of the provided URL.
Parses the HTML using Cheerio to extract key SEO elements (title, meta description, H1 tags, image alt tags, and canonical tag).
Calculates an SEO score based on the presence or absence of these elements.
Sends the results back to the frontend as JSON.
Frontend: index.html
The frontend consists of a simple HTML page styled with Tailwind CSS and contains:

A form to input the URL.
A section to display the analyzed SEO results.
JavaScript (in script.js or inline) handles the form submission, sends a POST request to the backend, and updates the page with the analysis results.
Tailwind CSS
The project uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and modern styles. If you need to customize any styles, you can either edit the styles.css file or update the Tailwind configuration.

SEO Scoring Logic
The backend analyzes the following SEO elements:

Title Tag: Checks if a <title> tag exists and if it has content. Missing titles reduce the SEO score.
Meta Description: Checks for the presence of a <meta name="description"> tag with content. Missing or empty meta descriptions reduce the score.
H1 Tags: Checks for the presence of at least one <h1> tag. More than one H1 tag or no H1 tag affects the score.
Image Alt Tags: Checks for the presence of alt attributes in <img> tags. Missing alt attributes reduce the score.
Canonical Tag: Checks for a <link rel="canonical"> tag. Missing canonical tags reduce the score.
SEO Score: A base score of 100 is adjusted based on missing elements, following a basic scoring system.
Future Enhancements
JavaScript-heavy websites: Add functionality to handle JavaScript-rendered pages using headless browsers like Puppeteer.
More SEO checks: Check for additional SEO metrics, such as mobile-friendliness, proper URL structures, structured data, etc.
Export reports: Allow users to download the SEO analysis as a PDF or CSV file.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues like Cannot GET /, ensure that the frontend files are being served correctly using express.static() in your Node.js server.

If you run into CORS issues, ensure that the backend allows cross-origin requests. You can use the cors package to enable CORS in your Express app.
